Project for Hack Beanpot 2015

Hack Beanpot was held February 6-8, 2015 at the Cambridge Innovation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many Boston-area college students, particularly from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, come together to participate in this event and "make dope stuff."

All of us, at one point or another, have been using Google Maps or other navigation system, and have thought, “This is too easy. It tells me where to turn, and I know where I’m going. I need more of a challenge!”

Well now, Hot+Cold can fix both of those problems. With Hot+Cold, all you do it pick a location category, the maximum distance you want to travel, and you’re off! The app will pick a destination that fits within your category, but won’t tell you what it is. Depending on which way you walk, you will receive feedback telling you whether you’re getting hotter or colder. The feedback takes the form of text that reloads often, so you know from minute to minute if you’re heading in the right direction. Additionally, the entire screen changes color from blue to red as you approach your destination.

Upon reaching your destination, you will be notified and receive some information about the location so you know for sure you have arrived. Categories include restaurants, museums, historical sites, parks, and geocaches. You can select a distance up to ten miles away from your current location. Not only does this app defeat the ennui surrounding choosing a place to go, but it gives you a fun way to get there as well.
