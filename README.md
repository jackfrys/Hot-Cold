# Hot-Cold
Project for Hack Beanpot 2015

Hack Beanpot was held February 6-8, 2015 at the Cambridge Innovation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many Boston-area college students, particularly from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, come together to participate in this event and "make dope stuff."

Have you ever used Google Maps and just thought to youself "this is just too easy?" Hot & Cold aims to solve this problem.

Have you ever used an app to help you find a place to eat but you keep saying "nah" to every suggestion? We've solved that too.

Just specify a category of destination and how far you're willing to walk, and we'll guide you the whole way there. Have fun responding to the subtle and age-old "hot" and "cold" clues, and find new places of interest in your area.
